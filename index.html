        <p>
            My name is Anna and I'm a software engineer. I have experience with JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Mongoose, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, Webpack, jQuery, Git, Heroku, AWS, Canvas, Google Maps API, SCSS, RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, OOP, and TTD.

            I just graduated from the App Academy's software engineering bootcamp and am excited to be on the job hunt. In my free time I love playing with my dogs, getting a little crafty (recently been making some amigurumi squeaky dog toys), and reading. I've read and rated over 1300 books on my GoodReads profile. One of my personal projects was a clone of Amazon's GoodReads website. I changed it up a little bit and called mine goodBoys, instead of asking my users to rate and review their books, I asked my humans to rate and reflect on their past relationships.

            I'm a huge fan of games, strategy, and game logic, from Tetris to Settlers of Catan. I love puzzles and one of my favorite facts is that American based games tend to have a greater RNG factor than European games. I really like the logic behind dungeon trawlers like Hades and Slay the Spire, but can also get really into games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. Concerned Ape is one of my heroes.
